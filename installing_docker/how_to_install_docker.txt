So, let’s get started by first installing Docker on Ubuntu operating system.

Docker installation On Ubuntu

Step 1: To install docker on Ubuntu box, first let us update the packages.

Command:
sudo apt-get update

This will ask for the password. Type your own "password" after the $


Step 2: Now before installing docker, I need to install the recommended packages. For that, just type in the below command:

Command:
sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r) linux-image-extra-virtual

Press “y” to continue. 

After this, we are done with the pre-requisites! Now, let’s move ahead and install Docker.

Step 3: Type in the below command to install docker engine:

Command:
sudo apt-get install docker-engine

Sometimes it will ask again ask for the password. Hit enter and the installation will begin.


One this is done, your task to install docker will be completed!

Step 4: So let’s just simply start the docker service. For that, just type in the below command:

Command:
sudo service docker start

It says your job is already running. Congratulations! docker has been successfully installed.

Step 5: Now just to verify that docker is successfully running, let me show you how to pull a CentOS image from docker hub and run the CentOS container. For that, just type in the below command:

Command:
sudo docker pull centos

First, it will check the local registry for CentOS image. If it doesn’t find there, then it will go to the docker hub and pull the image.

So we have successfully pulled a centOS image from docker hub. Next, let us run the CentOS container. For that, just type in the below command:

Command:
sudo docker run -it centos

So to summarize, We have first installed docker on Ubuntu, after that we have pulled a CentOS image from docker hub and using that image, we have successfully built a CentOS container. To know more about docker containers and how it works, you can refer this blog on Docker Container.
